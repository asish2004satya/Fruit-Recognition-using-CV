#**Problem Statement**

Manual fruit sorting is inefficient, inconsistent, and resource-intensive. Existing automated
solutions are often hardware-based, costly, and rigid. A low-cost, flexible, and software-based
approach using deep learning can provide an efficient alternative.
The key problems include:
 Inconsistent classification due to human error.
 Time-consuming and labor-intensive sorting.
 Need for accurate and real-time fruit recognition.


#**Objectives**

 To design a deep learning model for accurate fruit classification.
 To train the model on a diverse and labeled fruit image dataset.
 To implement the model using Python and TensorFlow.
 To evaluate the model based on accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
 To analyze its performance against existing benchmarks.


#**Scope of the Projec**t

This project focuses on classifying fruits from images using CNNs. The classification will be
performed on a dataset consisting of fruits like apple, banana, grapes, mango, and orange. The
model will be trained, validated, and tested on this dataset. The implementation will be limited
to software simulation without hardware integration.
 Methodology Overview

 
#**The methodology adopted for this project includes**:

 **Data Collection**: Gathering and organizing fruit images.
 **Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
 **Model Building**: Designing the CNN architecture.
 **Training**: Optimizing weights using backpropagation and gradient descent.
 **Testing and Evaluation**: Assessing model performance.
Each of these phases will be elaborated in the subsequent chapters.
